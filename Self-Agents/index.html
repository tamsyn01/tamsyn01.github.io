            What we do tells us, and others, a lot about who we are. On the one hand, who we are determines what we do. On the other hand, acting is also a process of self‐discovery and self‐shaping. 
            Pivotal to this mutual shaping of self and agency is the sense of agency, or agentive self‐awareness, that is, the sense that one is the agent of an action.

        Agency begins with what you let into your mind, with what comes in from your environment. If you are lacking agency, it’s likely your attention is being taken and you need to figure out how to restore it

            Its time to take back your life. Often we are weighted by the stress of our enviroment and the growing mental hurt of the larger community. But we can increase our sense of self agency, even if in small ways, making you a happier more accomplished individual.

        Changing small parts of our enviroment gives us an abilty to regain movement and focuse in our lives.
        An important part of our enviroment we may discount is the influence of other people.
        It’s impossible not to be affected by those around us, too easy to absorb their emotions.
        That means you should set boundaries with difficult people:
        its an encredible hard thing to do, but doesn’t mean removing people from your life, rather its about recognising the entanglments around us. 
        Online forumns and work enviroments often arrouse negative interactions and provoke groupthink.
        Instead, make an effort to surround yourself with friends, family, and communities who make you happy and provide a reality check when you are stuck in negative thinking. 
        People with high levels of agency are continually learning more and expanding their capacity to learn by adopting a more open, collaborative approach to everything in life. This requires nurturing your curiosity and allowing yourself to explore new ideas, skills, and people.
        You can take an interesting class, explore your world kinetically (through your hands or body), or spend time playing or using your imagination. 
        This isn’t always easy. Practicing a growth mindset, where you recognize that you are a work in progress, capable of learning and changing, can help combat the fear of failure or judgment that often come with learning new things. If you have trouble letting go of perfectionism, it might help to practice mindfulness meditation, which has been shown to reduce self-judgment, or use cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques that help put mistakes in perspective.
        Manage your emotions and beliefs
        Too often, we operate from unconscious beliefs, ‘I’m too old to learn a new job skill’ or ‘No one will ever want to be in a relationship with me’, without being aware of how they thwart us from even trying certain things. When we are driven by unconscious emotions like fear, sadness, or worry, it can lower our energy and make us feel doomed or overwhelmed, which also hurts our agency.
        Increasing your awareness of how your emotions and beliefs drive your thinking, influence your behavior, and affect your judgment will help you navigate life with greater confidence. While uncovering these inner thoughts and emotions may take effort, being more self-reflective helps you keep grounded by slowing down your thinking process.
        Take yourself to a quiet place. Consciously let go of the tension building up in your muscles. These simple techniques will relax you and keep you more self-aware. This enhances your agency by putting you more in charge of what you feel and think.
        By learning how to recognize our inner emotions and thoughts,name them, and let them pass through us, we can practice more self-control, which also helps build greater agency.
        We can also take advantage of our natural intuition. Think of intuition as deep inner knowledge that is comprised of millions of data points that our brains have observed over the course of our lives. When used wisely, it can be a tremendous boost to our creativity and help us make important decisions, thereby increasing our level of agency.
