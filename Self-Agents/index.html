            What we do tells us, and others, a lot about who we are. On the one hand, who we are determines what we do. On the other hand, acting is also a process of self‐discovery and self‐shaping. 
            Pivotal to this mutual shaping of self and agency is the sense of agency, or agentive self‐awareness, that is, the sense that one is the agent of an action.
